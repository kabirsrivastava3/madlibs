##What is Madlib?

In a traditional Madlib, you would have a bunch of blanks in a paragraph. 
And you would have somebody fill out those blanks and then read the paragraph  out loud with the words that they chose in those blanks. 

So we're going to recreate this project in Python using string concatenation.
